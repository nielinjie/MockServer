#RAML

RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) provides a structured, unambiguous format for describing a RESTful API. It allows you to describe your API; the endpoints, the HTTP methods to be used for each one, any parameters and their format, what you can expect of a response and more.

You can use RAML in a number of ways:

* It can be used in the design and specification stage to describe the API you plan to build
* You can use RAML to generate documentation
* RAML can be used to implement interactive API consoles
* You can test against RAML
* It be used to generate mock API responses

In this chapter the focus will be on mocking API responses.

## Writing RAML

The first thing to note is that RAML is a derivative of http://www.yaml.org/[YAML]. You’ll find it easier to work with RAML if you’ve written YAML before, but if you haven’t then it’s relatively straightforward, or you can read this http://www.sitepoint.com/using-yaml-in-php-projects/[tutorial]. Because they’re simply text files, you can use any text editor or IDE to create and edit them.

A RAML file starts with a declaration, indicating the format:

    #%RAML 0.8

Typically you’d then provide some meta-information about your API, for example:

    title: My Example API
    version: v1

`title` is a required field, `version` is optional.

You should then provide the Base URI for your API. At its simplest, it can be in the following format:

    baseUri: http://example.uniknow.org/

You can also use URI parameters. For example it’s common practice to incorporate a version identifier into API URLs; if you’re taking that approach with yours, you can do this:

    baseUri: http://api.acme.com/{version}/

We’ll look at URI parameters in more detail later on, since they become vital when describing resources.

You can also indicate whether your API is available over HTTPS by setting the protocols field, for example:

    protocols: [ HTTP, HTTPS ]

You can specify the default media type which your API will return, for example:

    mediaType: application/json

Later when we look at responses, we’ll look at how you can describe multiple response media types, and what to expect from them.

You can also incorporate additional documentation – or pages – into your RAML file. For example:

    documentation
	    - title: Home
		    content:
			    This example documentation is part of a [DocMockRest]({site.url})
			    RAML documentation.

NOTE: Notice how you can include Markdown in your meta-information.

There are some other things you can include here, such as how security is implemented, as well as defining traits. We’ll look at these concepts a little later.

That’s much of the basic information covered, so now let’s move onto resources.
